1. Learn HTML
    - [x] Learn the basics and how to write semantic HTML
        - HTML is made up of 2 things: content and markup to describe that content. 
        - When a site’s markup is “semantic,” it means the tags appropriately describe the content.
        - Before a browser can render content, it has to read a website’s HTML and then figure out what to do with it.
        
          Every HTML tag has its own default styles and behavior, so if the wrong tag gets used on some content, that element won’t           work in the browser as expected.
          
          Semantic markup keeps websites working in a consistent and usable way.

    - [] Media Queries and Responsive Websites
        - Media queries are useful when you want to apply CSS styles depending on a device's:
            - General type (such as print vs. screen).
            - Specific characteristics (such as the width of the browser viewport)
            - Environment (such as ambient light conditions)
        - With the huge variety of internet-connected devices available today, media queries are a vital tool for building websites and apps that are robust enough to work on whatever hardware your users have.
