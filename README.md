1. Learn HTML
    - [x] Learn the basics and how to write semantic HTML
        - HTML is made up of 2 things: content and markup to describe that content. 
        - When a site’s markup is “semantic,” it means the tags appropriately describe the content.
        - Before a browser can render content, it has to read a website’s HTML and then figure out what to do with it.
          Every HTML tag has its own default styles and behavior, so if the wrong tag gets used on some content, that element won’t           work in the browser as expected.
          Semantic markup keeps websites working in a consistent and usable way.
